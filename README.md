TASK OBJECTIVES:

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.  
This project covers:
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and engineering new features.
- Training machine learning models to predict survival.
- Evaluating model performance and interpreting the results.

STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT:

1. Clone the Repository:
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/ShravaniKulkarni04/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git)
  
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   cd Titanic-Survival-Prediction
  
3. Install Required Libraries:
   Make sure Python 3 is installed. Then install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb
   
5. Dataset
   - Ensure `titanic.csv` is available in the same directory as the notebook.
   - If stored elsewhere, update the file path in the notebook accordingly.

CODE QUALITY

- Well-organized and modular code with clear sectioning for EDA, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- Detailed comments to explain each step for better understanding.
- Proper handling of missing data and feature engineering for improved model performance.
- Visualizations to support data insights and model results.
- Consistent coding practices followed for readability and maintenance.
